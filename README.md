- Car Zone is a website which integrates both car buyers and sellers on one platform.

- The objective is to interact with the user and if he/she is a buyer he/she will navigate to the cars section and explore cars present. if he/she is a seller, still navigate to the cars section and explore the cars to understand the marketing of cars. Any user who wants to sell car can contact to admin by filling the form present in the contacts page.

- Any user who wants to sell car can contact the admin by filling the form present in the contacts page. any user who wishes to buy car can inquire about the car using inquiry form present for each car.

- The main motto is to build an effective car selling website which acts as a bridge between both seller and buyer besides maintaining security and terms of both users and website.

- There are tons of instances in many websites where users post fake postings of their cars and cheat buyers in many ways. To stop this, we directly build a form submission which triggers an email to admin. so that admin can get in touch with the seller and contact with further steps of posting the seller's car.

- you can see some of the website pictures in the [website images](https://github.com/dev-venkateshnagumantri/cars_world-gitproject/tree/master/website%20images) section.
